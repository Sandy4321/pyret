Installation
============

Basic
-----

The fastest way to install is by grabbing the code from Github:

.. code:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/baccuslab/pyret.git
    $ cd pyret
    $ python setup.py install

Dependencies
------------

Pyret requires that you have ``numpy``, ``scipy``, ``matplotlib``, and ``seaborn`` installed.

Development
-----------

To contribute to ``pyret``, you'll need to also install ``sphinx`` for documentation and
``nose`` for testing. We adhere to the `NumPy/SciPy documentation standards <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt#docstring-standard>`_.
