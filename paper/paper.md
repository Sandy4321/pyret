# Summary

The Pyret package contains tools for analyzing neural electrophysiology data. It focuses
on applications in sensory neuroscience, broadly construed as any experiment in which
one would like to characterize neural responses to a sensory stimulus. Pyret contains 
methods for manipulating spike trains (e.g. binning and smoothing); pre-processing 
experimental stimuli (e.g. resampling); computing spike-triggered averages and 
ensembles [@Schwartz2006]; estimating linear-nonlinear cascade models 
[@Chichilnisky2001,@Pedregosa2011] to predict neural responses to different stimuli; 
as well as a suite of visualization tools for all the above.
