pyret: retinal data analysis in python
======================================

`pyret`_ is a library for pre-processing, analyzing, and visualizing data from retina electrophysiology experiments.
It was written because we think sharing code and data withing the scientific community is easiest when there are open
standards to adhere to.

.. note:: Pyret is under active development. Please refer to these pages or the Github repository for the latest info.
