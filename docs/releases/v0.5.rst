==================
v0.5 (17 Nov 2016)
==================

New features
------------
- Better handling of low-rank STA component signs in ``filtertools.lowranksta``.
- Functionality for embedding STA animations into HTML, via ``visualizations.anim_to_html()``.
- New classes for estimating nonlinearities: ``Binterp``, ``Sigmoid`` and 
  ``GaussianProcess``. These follow the ``scikit-learn`` interface, meaning
  they have ``fit()`` and ``predict()`` methods, which return ``self``.

API changes
-----------
- Renamed ``filtertools.getsta`` -> ``filtertools.sta``
- Renamed ``filtertools.getste`` -> ``filtertools.ste``
- Renamed ``filtertools.getstc`` -> ``filtertools.stc``
- Renamed ``visualizations.rasterandpsth`` -> ``visualizations.raster_and_psth``
- Renamed ``visualizations.plotcells`` -> ``visualizations.plot_cells``
- Renamed ``visualizations.plotsta`` -> ``visualizations.plot_sta``
- Renamed ``visualizations.playrates`` -> ``visualizations.play_rates``
- Renamed ``visualizations.playsta`` -> ``visualizations.play_sta``
- ``spiketools.binspikes`` and ``spiketools.estfr`` no longer return the time axis. Only the
  binned spikes and firing rate are returned, respectively.
- Removed ``containers`` module.
- ``filtertools.rolling_window`` has been moved to the ``stimulustools`` module,
  and is renamed ``slicestim``. ``rolling_window`` is an alias for ``slicestim``,
  for the time being, which raises a warning about future deprecation.
- Renamed ``stimulustools.stimcov`` -> ``stimulustools.cov``.
- Renamed ``stimulustools.upsample_stim`` -> ``stimulustools.upsample``.
- Renamed ``stimulustools.downsample_stim`` -> ``stimulustools.downsample``.
