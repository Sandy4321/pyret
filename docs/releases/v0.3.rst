API changes
-----------
- Changed the `filtertools` module's `getste`, `getsta`, and `getstc` to use
  generators. The `getste` function now returns a generator that yields samples
  from the spike-triggered ensemble, while `getsta` and `getstc` consume that
  generator in order to compute their results.
